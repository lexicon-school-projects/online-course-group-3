A beginner's course for those interested in learning how to look at, appreciate and enjoy the visual arts. Weekly lectures introduce
theoretical concepts that are reaffirmed with discussion and corresponding studio assignments. Students will explore basic concepts of
line, shape, mass, color, balance, texture and composition by way of in-class critiques and hands-on projects. A museum trip may be
included in this course.
